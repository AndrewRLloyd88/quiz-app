# Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using the below information in step 2 for reference
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information

- DB_USER="ELEPHANT SQL DB NAME"
- DB_HOST=lallah.db.elephantsql.com
- DB_PASS="ELEPHANT SQL DB PASS"
- DB_PORT=5432
- DB_NAME="ELEPHANT SQL DB NAME"
- Uncomment and set to true for Heroku
- DB_SSL=true if heroku
- DB_PORT=5432
- PORT=3000

- SECRET_KEY_1="ENTER A SECRET KEY"
- SECRET_KEY_2="ENTER A SECOND SECRET KEY"

3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`

- Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB

7. Run the server: `npm run local`

- Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server

8. Visit `http://localhost:3000/`

# Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples.
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds.
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database.
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.

# Known Major Issues

- quizzes are not scoring and updating correctly yet on both teacher end and for student the server will hang https://github.com/andreiskandar/quiz-app/issues/64

- quizzes are limited currently to 1 question per quiz due to the way the DB is set up. The quiz_id auto increments as it is a serial primary key auto incrementing on each post request to the server on quiz creation. https://github.com/andreiskandar/quiz-app/issues/66

- the share quiz link needs updating to be correct currently e.g http://localhost:3000/quiz/1 will go to our forbidden page. The link needs to be:
http://localhost:3000/quiz/12/questions/15 (our questions are tied to the question_id in our database)

- there is currently no option to give the user feedback on their answer, did they get the Q right or wrong and why? https://github.com/andreiskandar/quiz-app/issues/63

- When a user starts a quiz there is no way to cleanly navigate away from the quiz: https://github.com/andreiskandar/quiz-app/issues/68

- When the user fiishes a quiz only the navbar-brand works: https://github.com/andreiskandar/quiz-app/issues/67
